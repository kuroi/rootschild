# Roots Child Theme

[Roots](https://github.com/retlehs/roots) is a starting WordPress theme made for developers thatâ€™s based on
[HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) and [Bootstrap from Twitter](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

Out of the box, Roots has limited support for child themes (https://github.com/retlehs/roots/issues/461).

This child theme tweaks the Roots activation process to load all theme assets (css, images and js) from this child theme, thus side-stepping the issues that have proven problematic.
